These measurements can have important physical consequences, such as allowing us to infer the mass of two stars orbiting in a binary (see lecture). \n",

With that measurement in hand, the [Doppler equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) dictates how to convert the change in wavelength to a velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a single line can be limited however, if, for example, the spectrum is low signal to noise or there are multiple processes contributing to the line profile. \n",
    "\n",
    "One can use \"all the information\" present in a spectrum to estimate the redshift/Doppler shift via a [cross correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation) with a template spectrum (see also the lecture notes). The (discrete) cross-correlation is the sum of the observed spectrum multiplied by the template. \n",
